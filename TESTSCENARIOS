General ideas:
* Integrate the api for getting the data to login and prepare for more tests the acocrding data there
* since the emulation was not working on circleci invest time for other options
** https://www.browserstack.com as an solution (using this currently for browser automation in jenkins integrated , performing weel but cost money)
** Firebase (found this after some investigation, here i would need some time to check if this is an better solution than browserstack)
* may trying to create another structure on the tests to have in the end the test inf iles where just small 
  descriptive tests are in and the testlogic would be stored in other classes

Possible TestScenarios

Testscenarios simulating the loss of the Data/GPRS connection:
1)
* Log in 
* Simulate an interruption of the data connection during Log in
(a log out should be performed)

2)
* Log in
* Search your Driver 
* Simulate an interruption Location detection (no gps, mobile connection wifi)
(a log out should be performed)

Testscenarios simulating further log in scenarios:
1)
* Try to Log in with invalid data
(a log out should be performed)

2)
* Try to Log in using an Injection (according to OWASP top 10 Risk List)
(no log in should be perfomred)
3)
* Try to Log in with invalif data several times
(a message should be come up and the account should be blocked)

Testscenarios after beeing loged in:
1)
* Log in an wait 
(a log out should be performed)
2)
* Log in
* Search driver when more drivers are saved within the application (sa should then for example have more then 3 entries)
(should still perform well)

Testscenarios with different devices:
first a list of the app distribution and take the top 3 by operating system and displaysize
1)
* Log in 
* Select driver
* Call driver
